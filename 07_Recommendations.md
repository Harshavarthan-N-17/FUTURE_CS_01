# Recommendations for Identified Vulnerabilities

This document provides recommended fixes for the vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability assessment report.

## 1. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Issue:** No CSP policy, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Fix:** Add the following CSP header in the web server configuration:

```apache
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';"
```

## 2. Website Uses HTTP Instead of HTTPS
**Issue:** Website is running on HTTP, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks.

**Fix:** Enable HTTPS using an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache
```

Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

## 3. Sensitive File Accessible (/server-status)
**Issue:** Exposed server-status page leaks Apache server information.

**Fix:** Restrict access to localhost only:

```apache
<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Require local
</Location>
```

## 4. Missing Clickjacking Protection
**Issue:** Website can be embedded in malicious iframes.

**Fix:** Add X-Frame-Options header:

```apache
Header always set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
```

## 5. Server Version Disclosure
**Issue:** The server banner leaks version details.

**Fix:** Hide the version details in Apache/Nginx:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off
```

## 6. Missing Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)
**Issue:** Resources can be accessed from different origins.

**Fix:** Add CORP policy:

```apache
Header always set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-origin"
```

## 7. Missing Permissions Policy Header
**Issue:** No restrictions on browser features like camera, microphone, geolocation.

**Fix:** Add a Permissions Policy:

```apache
Header always set Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=()"
```

## 8. Web Server Header Leaks Version Information
**Issue:** The "Server" response header exposes web server details.

**Fix:** Hide the server tokens:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off
```

## 9. Missing MIME-Sniffing Protection
**Issue:** Browser MIME-sniffing can misinterpret file types, causing security risks.

**Fix:** Add the X-Content-Type-Options header:

```apache
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
```

## 10. Suspicious Comments in Source Code
**Issue:** HTML/JavaScript contains sensitive comments that may leak information.

**Fix:**
- Remove all sensitive comments from HTML, JavaScript, and PHP files.
- Regularly check the source code for debugging comments.

## 11. Sensitive Data Caching in Browser
**Issue:** The application stores sensitive data in browser cache, increasing the risk of session hijacking.

**Fix:** Add cache-control headers to prevent sensitive data from being stored:

```apache
Header always set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0"
```

## ✅ Conclusion
Implementing these security recommendations will:
✔ Improve application security.
✔ Prevent common attacks.
✔ Protect user data and server information.
